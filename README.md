In this repo I continue practicing React concepts learned while following this great course https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/.
The code lets you add a user (username and age) and render it inside a list.
When adding the user to the list, the content is validated by checking that no field is left empty and the age is not <0. In case of error, a Modal component is shown and this can be closed either by clicking on the close button or outside the modal.
